    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
   <ul>
    <li> inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element  </li>
    <li>Internal - by  using a style element in the head section </li>
    <li>External - by using link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in External CSS files. However. <span class="item-five" >in this <br>
         tutorail we will use inline and internal styles, </span> because this is casier to demonstrate, and casser <br>
          for you to try yourself.    </li>
   </ul>
   <p para-1>When comparing CSS class vs ID , the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple.element ID.on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element .ID is also <br>
    special is that you can use a special URL,to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript

   <p> In CSS,selector are used to target a specific element or range of elemnts on a web page.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the <br>
       element   </p> 
       <p> There is a wide range of selector available, Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied. </p>
